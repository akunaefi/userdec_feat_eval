You can turn this off but I literally never see notifications for things that are important. In the app notifications it spams you with a lot of jargon disguised as useful information that you have to open the app and check and clear out. Unsubscribing from all of them is a hassle because they seemingly have a different one for each day of the month. Jobs need to have a filter for what level of skill is needed. As a computer scientist, many entry level positions ask for multiple years of experience. This mean VASTLY different things to different companies. Many 'entry-level' positions just put years required just because they are looking for just some familiarity. As a recent college graduate I DO NOT want to even see senior software positions, and recruiters honestly do not want to see me applying there either. Promoted jobs are way to obtrusive, there might not be a good way around it but searching every few days and seeing the same promoted jobs posted a month ago wastes a bunch of time. Perhaps put a time-to-live after viewing so they only show at the top a few times instead of every time. Messaging will break for hours on end. The forums have nothing useful for the issue, and after searching for an hour turns out its impossible to get in contact with customer service because they have deleted any evidence of a helpline. It will take hours of effort to talk to a human for a niche issue. They REALLY want you to use the barebones FAQ that assumes you know nothing about how the app works and offers nothing for troubleshooting strange issues. Its way too easy for scam companies to contact you. Its very difficult to contact companies you have no connections with. It is hard to find the proper route to message companies with. Like sometimes I just want to talk to someone in HR about a job, but the only HR person I am available to connect with is the head of HR.

But ever since premium exist there's like so many ads pumping through that the app is frozen and force quitting 95% of the time and works WELL the other 5%.
