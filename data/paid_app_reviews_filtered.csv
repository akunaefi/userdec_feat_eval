1348,com.mojang.minecraftpe,2020-12-12 06:47:31,Brilliant game. Mojang Studios has really outdone themselves with the new content in this game. Ive been playing Minecraft for many years now and I have thought of a good feature they could include. If my custom skins were synced with computer and Xbox when I applied them to my phone. This is because I make my own skin but play on Xbox and you cannot use custom made skins on there,4,2
1349,com.mojang.minecraftpe,2020-12-29 16:43:43,Ok so I love this game to heart. I've played this game since i was 8 and love it but I have a small complaint. The skin creation feature is bugged.

Best feature in my opinion: how if they do something the community hates (for example, in 1.9 when we couldn't craft notch apples) they do something later to balance it (like how 1.16 made netherite need gold and gold bartering). Over all, it's truly a very creative, interesting, imaginative gameplay experience. And unlike most people, I'm quite alright with microtransactions.

I absolutely love that if it's a setting that I can think of then it exist and I can change it. Whether it's pen size/type, how I set up notebooks, import/export pdfs, how the program registers my pen or lets me zoom, or jus simply how it looks. If you don't like this program at first be sure to tinker around in the settings until it's set up just how you like it.",5,8
2220,com.acadoid.lecturenotes,2018-12-16 03:03:15,"I am a university professor. I mainly use this app as a note taking device that replaces my paper note pad. Recently, I projected my Samsung Tab S3 onto a TV using Roku so that all of my writing in the tablet can be seen in the TV and my graduate students can see the writing much better. This is by far the best note taking app in the Android system. I have tried several others. The things I like are: (1) the writing is very very smooth. You do not see the difference from witing on paper. (2) the note is always there and can be found long time after. (I started to use the LectureNotes after I purchased my Samsung Tab S3 in summer of 2017). (3) the zoom function is very neat. You can double tap and it becomes 125% zoom. Double tap again, you return to the original 100% zoom. (4) the app provided a lot of control in the setting, which I think is very useful as a frequent user. (5) more recently, I figured out a way to back up all the notes in PDF format into my Dropbox flder. This is very helpful because I can now access my notes in my Window 10 computer. (6) It has the back up feature to back up all the information into a zip file in Dropbox. I would think that I can import the zip file into my new tablet. (7) It seems to me the app does not take too much of the Tablet space. I could be wrong on this. The file size of the zip backup 140MB. I have a lot of notes (around 100, all of them are hand writing with mostly 10 page or more.) (8) it allows me to create a lot of folders ad sub folders. This helps me to get my notes organized.",5,12
2221,com.acadoid.lecturenotes,2019-02-20 02:17:49,"amazing app. its very nice to be able to customize all the pens. highly recommended. I waited to give a more detailed feedback. After some time of using it, not only I have enjoyed of nice digital writing to take my notes, but it has other nice features. The pdf version of the notes can actually be exported to a particular folder in your device, which made it amazing to sync it with your cloud services (this needs an external sync app, such as FolderSync). For a different export folder, make sure the app has storage permissions in the android settings. It has a million settings that allow you to set your notebooks completely as you want. I have my particular pens, highlighters, paper grids, etc.  So far no drawbacks.",5,8
2222,com.acadoid.lecturenotes,2019-08-02 00:22:42,"Just started, and even though it has a steep learning curve, I'm really enjoying it. Works with amazon fire tablet and some passive stylus perfectly (only without safe zone). Considering that steep curve, it would really help if there's some visual explanation for the options of automatic move of input field. It took me hours to figure it out exactly. Or some intro video. This is my first app of that type, maybe others are familiar with 'from which point it looks' :) Really nice, polished app.",5,3

I searched frantically to find out how to use LectureNotes as my PDF viewer, and sure enough this was already a feature. Just had to download one of their other apps. Great app!",5,2

2225,com.acadoid.lecturenotes,2020-02-23 23:45:13,I use this outstanding app several times a week to write answer keys for handouts in my college math classes. The layers feature allows me to write over my PDF handouts and make repeated edits without erasing parts of the original document. I like the variety of colors so that I can distinguish between necessary computations or explanations and incidental comments. I export the notes in PDF format for easy access by students.

Granted maybe they are little bit costly then this but still you are a competitor so give them something to compete for. This app lacks so much in terms of functionality when compared you yourself know this and i think in future we may see better version of your app with more functionality but for starters in next update atleast add these 2 functions. 1. it's annoying for us as a user to everytime crop the document by hand it should be done automatically 2. there should be option to lock the important documents with password. 3.

I've also sent you people a mail on your e-mail address. Thanks Akshay Bhardwaj,3,1

2875,com.piksoft.turboscan,2017-05-03 08:30:51,I just bought this app and all in all it's a good little app but it needs some work. I don't need to tell you the functionality your competitors on playstore are providing. Granted maybe they are little bit costly then this but still you are a competitor so give them something to compete for. This app lacks so much in terms of functionality when compared you yourself know this and i think in future we may see better version of your app with more functionality but for starters in next update atleast add these 2 functions. 1. it's annoying for us as a user to everytime crop the document by hand it should be done automatically 2. there should be option to lock the important documents with password. 3. Word of advice increase your application Price if you want to but provide same features as your competitors does. Thanks waiting for your reply and next version after that will increase rating 3 to 5 star.,3,2

Other areas that could be improved include: 1. Support attaching notes to individual scans 2.  Besides manual sort, add auto sort based on scan date or user-supplied ""real"" date (e.g. when a receipt was issued rather than the date it was scanned) 3. Keep the flashlight turned on instead of flashing for low-light conditions 4. Add compression % in settings for the scanned jpegs (I prefer no compression).

I am not sure why someone would think it would be a good idea to lock a bunch of apps into a hard to use 'bundle' but it breaks several usability features in Android itself.

Even worse, options only allow gestures in an all or nothing context, with no way to stick with only the original left/right gestures. To make matters worse, the ""now playing"" bar is tiny, giving you equal chance of accidentally hitting an item in the queue, or hitting a bottom bar button  2) Connecting to Bluetooth makes the app forget what it was doing - it will play the currently playing song, but instead of going to the next track in a shuffled playlist, it just seems to jump to a random library track. Requiring you to skip to the next song, then repeat the process of shuffling the playlist, before going back to the main screen.   3) Goodbye tap to pause/play - that action also goes to the queue (see #1), and now the controls are all the way over to the right.

That wouldn't be so bad if the widget would display the full album artwork at the full-size, rather than it being too small, and the shuffle and repeat icons hanging over the edge of it Sometimes, something is good enough without it being regenerated, and I must admit that so far I prefer the old version, and wish I could have kept it.",4,7

I love that it sends reminders every morning and evening to fill in the prompts which is good for a couple things: 1. It is a good reminder. 2. Even if I don't open the app and fill it in my mind automatically goes to thinking about things I'm grateful for or what good things that happened. I LOVE that I can add a picture with this app because it just adds as a quick visual reminder of the day. Great easy app to bring more gratitude in your life! Thank you!,5,4

This app provides a very simple system that sets me up in the morning to be in a more positive frame of mind, and prompts me to notice the things that nourish me during the day. I am also finding it an 'early warning system' for elevated levels of depression or anxiety. The days when I can't focus in on anything to be grateful for, are significant.

I've looked everywhere online for anyway to override the ridiculous way of backing up and restoring your reading progress, bookmarks and highlights. Unfortunately if you have tk move the folder since the two devices you own call you root folder something different (my changed from sdcard0 to just sdcard) you are essentially screwed. You will lose everything. Granted you can restore you reading position by opening EVERY SINGLE BOOK. This is tedious if you have 10 books but down right excruciating when you're in the hundreds. Despite this my biggest grief is that ALL MY BOOKMARKS ARE MADE REDUNDANT. Due to the root folder being changed one character and is out of my control. I tried syncing which lo and behold did not work. We need an option to be able to override the base file location by PC or otherwise. Better yet an option to do a full back up (including the files itself). Or to reprogram everything to work from root the actual root folder rather than the location address.

Oldie but Goodie!! ---&gt;&gt; Among other perks, it has the tools for me to create and amazingly stylize images/artwork. FOR example, Wallpaper ... I created my beloved jellyfish amongst bubbles and babies in the depths of the ocean currents featuring rock formations and aquatic plants. How? First, use PicsArt to make black background, and import pics of rocks, seaweed, bubbles, and solid stripes of grey, blue, purple, pink, green -- ALL of the above items taking up LESS THAN 1/6th of the black background. Then, send it to TouchRetouch, and get going! Created my own mama jellyfish (her name's Trixie) and babies in their sea world! Blend my colors, gradients, soften, blur, create 3D, ETC!!  Hundreds of creations, over the years. My all-time favorite phone app!!! The app's NEW version doesn't allow for this kind of creating and editing. Once upon a time, before I bought the pro version, I did use it only to erase ... for the basics. Liked so much, that I bought full version. Otherwise, the NEW VERSION remains great for erasing. Certainly, it continues to delight MANY. However, I DEEPLY, DEARLY wish that ADVA SOFT would ALSO OFFER the OLD app (the version I've used for years), for loyal users like me. It's TOO inconvenient to update apps as a bundle -- auto-update -- on GooglePlayStore, DUE to THIS NEWER APP. The update steals away THE APP I COUNT ON. Every time, when THE NEW app updates my old one, I have to clear data and uninstall the NEW one, in order to be able to reinstall the one I bought, stored in my DROPBOX. You know what that means. Ground Zero. Please, dear Developer, won't you simply add a page offering the OLD PAID APP, vers 9(3.2.1)? No trouble to make it clear that this is an old version, with NO SUPPORT!! In doing so, faithful fans like me will be able to SHOW that we've installed THAT app, and NOT the SISTER app. Headache GONE re: PlayStore updates.

Oldie but Goodie!! ---&gt;&gt; Among other perks, it has the tools for me to create and amazingly stylize images/artwork. FOR example, Wallpaper ... I created my beloved jellyfish amongst bubbles and babies in the depths of the ocean currents featuring rock formations and aquatic plants. How? First, use PicsArt to make black background, and import pics of rocks, seaweed, bubbles, and solid stripes of grey, blue, purple, pink, green -- ALL of the above items taking up LESS THAN 1/6th of the black background. Then, send it to TouchRetouch, and get going! Created my own mama jellyfish (her name's Trixie) and babies in their sea world! Blend my colors, gradients, soften, blur, create 3D, ETC!!  Hundreds of creations, over the years. My all-time favorite phone app!!! The app's NEW version doesn't allow for this kind of creating and editing. Once upon a time, before I bought the pro version, I did use it only to erase ... for the basics. Liked so much, that I bought full version. Otherwise, the NEW VERSION remains great for erasing. Certainly, it continues to delight MANY. However, I DEEPLY, DEARLY wish that ADVA SOFT would ALSO OFFER the OLD app (the version I've used for years), for loyal users like me. It's TOO inconvenient to update apps as a bundle -- auto-update -- on GooglePlayStore, DUE to THIS NEWER APP. The update steals away THE APP I COUNT ON. Every time, when THE NEW app updates my old one, I have to clear data and uninstall the NEW one, in order to be able to reinstall the one I bought, stored in my DROPBOX. You know what that means. Ground Zero. Please, dear Developer, won't you simply add a page offering the OLD PAID APP, vers 9(3.2.1)? No trouble to make it clear that this is an old version, with NO SUPPORT!! In doing so, faithful fans like me will be able to SHOW that we've installed THAT app, and NOT the SISTER app. Headache GONE re: PlayStore updates.

There are a few very annoying choices made by the developer. When you open a file for editing, the default sort order is by filename ascending which on a smart phone with a lot of pictures you could be scrolling for days to get to the bottom of the list. There is a choice to change the sort order but it is not persistent so if you use frequently like I do, the work flow is ""1 OPEN ALBUM"", ""2 CHANGE SORT ORDER"" to ""MOST RECENT FIRST"". The second annoying choice is not to start in a fileview first, it starts with two choices ""ALBUM"" or ""TUTORIAL"". It should be file view by default and ""HELP"" should be synonyous with ""TUTORIAL"". I don't think there are any users which choose to go to a TUTORIAL everytime they open the application. The third thing that does not work well is not being able to just use the current default location where photos are stored as the default folder, if this was a setting you could change the behavior. Why I have to choose where to hunt for photos every time I am opening an image to edit is a poor choice.",4,60

I haven't heard back from anyone since or seen them resolve this. I paid for the app, so I hope this issue does get resolved. That was a month ago I emailed them. The app would be perfect for me as a professional photographer, but unfortunately when removing the wires, like telephone wires, you are still able to see the black line faintly and as a photographer that is not good for me.

It hasn't and I'm having buyer's remorse. First of all the maps are not as detailed as similar programs, more importantly is that the GPS tracking just draws a straight line from one point to the other it does not show your course along the way in active time. You have to go back to the trail and then back out to the map to find out where you've been. Major downfall",1,20

Is there a way to move existing waypoints to new locations using a background map? 5. Is there more information available in the app about fix and waypoint accuracy?  Like a way to record the accuracy of a waypoint, and set a required accuracy for a waypoint?  For example by setting a PDOP threshold?  Currently I wait until the compass screen displays an acceptable accuracy to copy a current position or record a current waypoint, like +/- 10 feet, but that does not guarantee the displayed +/- accuracy, which often is in flux, is associated with the position or waypoint I record. 6.

make subsequent repeat journeys where I follow that same track. I did use

its own GPS before relying on as a navigator for a smaller vessel that does 
not have the ability to make its way with its own onboard electronic 
navigation system. Before leaving shore, I added my waterway waypoints 
using manual address entry & using the touch feature of the map. They 
easily are stored in the Waypoint Manager. For my test use of this app, I 
crossed the lower bay from the west side (my home waypoint) to the Eastern 
Shore of VA at Cape Charles (my destination waypoint). This app guided & 
tracked my journey giving dynamic feedback as I progressed to my targeted 
waypoint. I enjoyed the ability to record my track and hope to be able to 
make subsequent repeat journeys where I follow that same track. I did use 
the Open Sea Map, but did not figure out how to get the channel markers to 
show. Would be good addition if it would use local position to provide

The +/-4m accuracy compares in speed and accuracy to the $300-$600 units. I need to know though how many hundreds if not thousands of points I can capture likewise the amount and density of line/track/path data I can create in real time... I am currently using this every day in a remote area and need to ensure how to save the data for easy use on a laptop, google earth and on a conventional gps.. either way, once you spend the ~$12 it is well worth it, spend the time on trial and error, learn to test the buttons and choices, export and important data asap in case of the usual crashing/theft etc.",4,5

The recipe importer Just Works in terms of ingredient accuracy for all the food blogs I frequent.  Adding recipes to a shopping list is easy and saves me at least 20 minutes every few days. This bit of functionality is certainly useful, but almost every other interaction with this app is clunky.  Ingredients and directions are stripped of context. For recipes with multiple parts (a sauce, different glazes), it's impossible to tell how much of an ingredient to add if it is listed multiple times. For example, if the Directions say ""add the salt"" in three different places, and there are three different amounts of salt listed in Ingredients.  This makes a huge chunk of the app (including the nice Ingredients/Directions horizontal split) unusable for most recipes I cook.  I always end up back at the site I imported the recipe from to figure out correct amounts for each part of the recipe.  Shopping lists reverts back to nothing checked if you leave them. If you accidentally click out in the middle of a trip, or pre check off ingredients you already have from a list you exported from a recipe and try to come back to it later, you start back at nothing checked. Deleting items is the way to go, but it's a tiny button and sort of a PITA to get to the edit menu for a list.  You can easily scale a recipe (super handy) but can't pin the scale. This means for the typical usage of scaling a recipe, adding it to a shopping list, and cooking it at a later time, you have to remember the exact scale you set it for your shopping list, or risk not having enough ingredients.

9344,fr.cookbookpro,2018-04-11 07:22:43,"This is one of my favorite apps on Android. Ihave the ad free version, and it's very much worth it. It somehow manages to download recipes from thousands of websites - without all the ad's you find there. It's also pretty easy to create your own recipe from scratch and share with freinds & family.   The only thing I'd ask for is the ability to autosync recipes with other people (such as my Mom) with a little note saying who the recipe came from.  -----------Update 4/10/18---------- I've been using the ad free version of this app for almost three years now. It has very much been a love/hate experience. With just a few minor tweaks it would be great. However; the developer isn't receptive to making any changes other than adding new sites to download from. Here's my wishlist:  1. Give me the option to purchase a version with a higher maximum limit of recipes without paying a recurring fee. It should be a one time buy. Maybe you could sell it in increments of 100 for a set price. The current maximum is way too small for any serious cook.  2. There needs to be a way to print recipe cards either for an emergency backup or to share my recipes with friends and relatives.   3. Backing up the recipes should be easier, and should produce a single file which can be saved on external media such as an SD card or thumbdrive. The current method makes it very difficult to see if the backup was successful.   4. Syncing between my tablet and my phone should not be subject to a maximum number of recipes. Once you exceed the max limit (I think it's around 100) you can't sync anymore without paying a recurring fee.  Hopefully you can find time to incorporate some or all of these changes.",4,2

9444,fr.cookbookpro,2018-04-11 07:22:43,"This is one of my favorite apps on Android. Ihave the ad free version, and it's very much worth it. It somehow manages to download recipes from thousands of websites - without all the ad's you find there. It's also pretty easy to create your own recipe from scratch and share with freinds & family.   The only thing I'd ask for is the ability to autosync recipes with other people (such as my Mom) with a little note saying who the recipe came from.  -----------Update 4/10/18---------- I've been using the ad free version of this app for almost three years now. It has very much been a love/hate experience. With just a few minor tweaks it would be great. However; the developer isn't receptive to making any changes other than adding new sites to download from. Here's my wishlist:  1. Give me the option to purchase a version with a higher maximum limit of recipes without paying a recurring fee. It should be a one time buy. Maybe you could sell it in increments of 100 for a set price. The current maximum is way too small for any serious cook.  2. There needs to be a way to print recipe cards either for an emergency backup or to share my recipes with friends and relatives.   3. Backing up the recipes should be easier, and should produce a single file which can be saved on external media such as an SD card or thumbdrive. The current method makes it very difficult to see if the backup was successful.   4. Syncing between my tablet and my phone should not be subject to a maximum number of recipes. Once you exceed the max limit (I think it's around 100) you can't sync anymore without paying a recurring fee.  Hopefully you can find time to incorporate some or all of these changes.",4,2

There is no differentiation for subparts. Real world concepts, on the other hand, have some subparts ordered and some freeform. 3) Should be multiple ways to format a subtree, not just one arbitrary way. e.g. justifications, staggered, freeform flowing, etc. 4) Should be able to move a whole subtree as a unit. 5) Ideally, there should be an export format that handles crosslinked relationships.

There is no differentiation for subparts.

Some ideas for improvement - ability to see premarket price movement on graph, ability to move ""crossbar"" on graph without need to open it in landscape mode.
