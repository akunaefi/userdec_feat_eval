Annoyingly different for different platforms which is due to pure laziness of the developer. Sync is a continuous problem. Requires too much time to sync and then get through ""failed to sync"" messages. Reinstalling does not fix the problem. My android does not see the watch.

648,com.fitbit.FitbitMobile,2020-12-06 18:36:35,So far my Fitbit experience has been very good. It motivates me to try a little harder to reach goals and I really like the messages of encouragement. Two issues that I have and which keep me from giving it 5 stars are: 1. It does not automatically chart exercise after a few minutes. I have to set it and if I've forgotten there is no record of having done any exercise. 2. Editing the Period Tracker so the dates are personalised is very difficult. I gave up and downloaded a separate app.,4,46

I read and understand the ""risk "" of trading, but should it be risky? Shouldnt it fun? I feel the stronger the friendship the more accurate the pokemon come out. I feel totally jiped in my last trade. I traded lengendaires with my best bud...both were 2k+ hp n 3 stars...we go less than 15k n 0 stars and charged 40kSD. At that amount shouldnt they have been 95% right?",2,6
1324,com.nianticlabs.pokemongo,2021-01-20 07:26:49,I fought in a legendary raid just now. The moment i recieved my rweards for winning my phone died. I was not able to catch the pokemon. I went home to charge my phone i went back to the gym to be able to have the chance to catch the pokemon and nothing happened just showed that i won the raid.

Niantic has not fixed this trying to shut them down or by adding any items into the game to just raise IVs to combat this. Pvp is becoming a bit pay wallish for being unrefined.

1744,com.nianticlabs.pokemongo,2021-01-20 01:11:41,Nice game but I have few suggestions. 1. Remove limit on field research Currently a player can have just one field research counted towards field research progress per day. 2. Enable sending friend request to players who can be sighted in gyms. 3. Real time pokemon battle with wild pokemons to catch them easily. 4. Increase daily limit on coins which one would get from defending gyms. Currently it's just 50.,4,0

1764,com.nianticlabs.pokemongo,2021-01-19 18:24:21,"Everything is great about the game, literally everything, except 2 for now. Remote raids passes are awesome, they make life so much easier, but they are a little expensive, I was hoping the price could just decrease by a little, this is not a huge problem, however it would help. As we've already come to gen 6 this year, there are much more pokemon than before. Especially mega evolution pokemon, regarding that, I hope Niantic takes note of this review as everything is great in the game, its just that before mega evolving a pokemon, the only source of that mega energy are from Mega raids. The problem is, I am a new player, I haven't mega-evolved most of the pokemon. I always look out for raids, especially Mega and 5-stars, however people only seem to battle in 5-star raids. I would always be the first one to enter the lobby for Mega-raids, but rarely anyone would join. Even if there were, its incredibly rare that more than 5 people would join. Which is another problem by itself, as the mega energy is given by timing. Basically, I'm not sure why but many people aren't interested in mega-evolving pokemon. So that leads to new players like me not being able to mega-evolve a pokemon even if I'm willing to spend money, as there's no alternative to getting mega energy when that specific pokemon is not mega-evolved. I hope Niantic reads this review and try to give an alternative or an easier access to mega energy. Thank you.",4,0

A lot easier that way. 4 moves , Atk, S.Atk, Def, S.Def, Spd, Accuracy, HP. The way Pokemon usually battle like in Nds.",5,11

If that is their idea of how to get a customer back, the'll be filing for bankrupcy soon. They really need a lesson in consent. Canceled and not renewing ever. In my book, once a company uses this kind of tactics to get my hard earned money, I inmediately discard them forever and make sure everyone knows what are they up to. Now they are offering cashbacks for renewing the license. Yeah right, like I want to deal with two-timing developers like this. They will probably send the cashback on 2022, considering the instructions for the offer are already explaining what to do to receive the ""cashback"" and what to do if you have problems receiving it.

4669,com.piriform.ccleaner,2020-10-16 10:20:05,I've had this app for over 10 years and it has improved each year. I count on this app and I depend on what it says it's going to do... And it does it. I have it on all my devices as well as my PC. I highly recommend to those of you reading this to just click the 'install' button and get it on your device now. I luv it!! 👍,4,14

5850,com.adsk.sketchbook,2021-01-10 02:44:43,"I absolutely love this app! Hands down. For sure one of the best free ones out here. I do recommend a stylus, even if it is one of those pens with a rubber tip at the end. It's like ProCreate but free.",5,0

5852,com.adsk.sketchbook,2020-11-16 18:19:13,This is like a dream come true for those who use the Desktop Versuon like myself.I recently got a Graphic Tablet that supported Android so I wanted to try this out.I had heard of Ibis Paint X and I have to say this is way way way better for Professional Artists Than that app can ever Be. Thus is so good if you want to do skecthing on the go if you have your tablet with you. 10/10 Would recommend (◡ ω ◡),5,3
5853,com.adsk.sketchbook,2020-11-26 20:49:58,Been using this app for 4 years alr lol and i just realized i haven't left a review. I am a chibi artist and tbh I like how simple this app is. I've tried almost every other mobile sketch app before but they never lasted for me not until I found this app. I even changed my phone and still stick with this app. all I wish is they provide cloud storage for both ios and android bcs it hasn't been fun for me when I switched from my iphone to huawei. Most of my wips are gone :( but still recommended👍,5,3
5854,com.adsk.sketchbook,2020-12-29 15:19:11,"I love this app. It's free and it's very easy to use. The only thing I would suggest to better this app is to add a feature where you a can create your own color palette. Other than that, I love it.",5,1

5861,com.adsk.sketchbook,2020-12-06 12:01:40,"Best drawing app. Recommending this a lot. Most of the ppl think that IbisPaint X is the best but it's best for illustration purposes only, SketchBook is the best for sketching drawing painting purposes, and both compared, SketchBook has more properties and easy-to-use controls while IbisPaint X doesn't match. So, technically it's all your choice. Get the app that suits you!",5,11

But other than that I wish there was more songs I like to listen to bombshell blond and it doesn't have many videos of except Nightcore's and I wish there wasn't just Nightcore but other than that grate.,5,139

You have a lot of different subject categories but only three pin selections at the top which causes constant scrolling to get back to the pin category you used one pin ago. Why aren't there six so the three or four we are using aren't lost and we have to go scrolling once again. Hope that makes sense.,4,18

P.s. it would be really nice if there were more erotica on kindle unlimited.,4,0
8667,com.amazon.kindle,2020-12-19 20:34:03,I am glad they have updated the app to delete books that a person no longer. wants.

8669,com.amazon.kindle,2020-12-18 20:42:53,Thank you for this app. All I want now is to share files (pdf etc.) between my PC and phone. You know like trough cloud storage or something.

8682,com.amazon.kindle,2020-11-16 01:40:03,Overall very good but I have a frustration with font size that I'm calling out here in the hope that Amazon will address. As you increase the font size there is a huge jump from having about 90 words showing on my phone screen (at 3 below the largest setting) to about 45 words on the screen (at 2 below the largest setting). For me 90 is too small but 45 words on the screen makes the font huge. There should be an option in between that shows about 70 words on the screen.,4,63

Program says its in the queue. 2 hours later, its still in the queue and the car battery is LOW! Some notifications I bypassed right away because I want to see how this program works before I give anybody money or my info, schedule for deletion tomorrow. Tried it again and was able to download maps. So far, so good. The detail is great. Tomorrow, I will use it to see if its better than Google. Revised, I prefer this app over Google! You hit the drive view and it is easier to view while you are driving. The search bar is smaller than Google so more map to see. Feedback, would like the sampling rate to be faster so the map updates faster than 10 seconds. The detail is less than Google which is good, better view of where you are going. The favorite is good except you have to type a more meaningful description and you must stop to do this, same with Google. New/finished street construction not updated on the map yet, waiting. I have turned off the wifi in the car so no ads but I am willing to pay for this app! Good job guys.",4,17

This one can actually pinpoint addresses unlike a lot of other offline GPS apps I tried. Very useful to me while delivering. To those of you complaining about outdated information: Any maps service (especially a free one) that don't squeeze every penny out of monetizing your location information will not have the budget Google Maps has to keep itself updated.

10622,com.gps.navigation.maps.route.directions,2020-09-09 21:04:29,"Great app! Here's my suggestions for improvement: --- I would like to see the lane guidance show up much sooner. By the time it shows on the display, you are already upon it. --- Would be nice to know the next turn before the 2 mile mark. The next turn should be shown all the time with the number of miles until you get to that turn. --- This goes along with my previous comment, if the road is continuous, it should not show the end of the road. If I am on route 44, it should not tell me to continue on route 44 in 5 miles, and then in another 6 miles and then again in 10 miles. If the route is the same, it should add them up and provide a total distance before you have to exit or make a major turn. --- Would be really awesome if someone could build in a road grade information display showing the road grade for the next x miles. Example: 7% grade 2 miles ahead for 3 miles. This would allow ample time to adjust your speed based on your load (or large RV in my case). Showing a profile view for the next 2 miles would be excellent. --- Needs to zoom out further when the next turn is more than 10 miles ahead so you can get a greater view of what's ahead. - The app crashes once in a while when trying to solve a route with multiple waypoints, but not too bad otherwise. I like using it.",5,5

They still haven't figured out how to properly staff confident personnel to make the dining experience even halfway normal. When you call for an order to go and they tell you it's going to be an hour wait demonstrates this all too well. Too bad because I really like their food and they could be very successful if they would hire competent staffing. I recommend Ninja Sushi,2,0

11510,com.yelp.android,2020-02-10 07:07:24,I enjoyed this restaurant a great deal. The ambience was superb and the food was good when I finally got it.

11511,com.yelp.android,2018-09-19 14:50:30,"Great app. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any accountability in that if Yelp says a restaurant is open until 10 and the store owners actually close 30 minutes before that time, you're out of luck going to a restaurant or store that you think should be open. Of course, this also impacts your experience should you try to get food elsewhere. Of course this may not be the fault of Yelp in every instance but there certainly but there should definitely be a system put into place to combat this issue.",4,1

I am also uncomfortable with how easily one could post and have posted reviews unrelated to the quality of the good or service the business provides to punish the business for an irrelevant and malicious reason.

The way you have it now, I have to click the Bookmark button, select a single Collection from a list, then the Bookmark list closes automatically ...and then I have to repeat the same procedure to add the same restaurant to an additional Collection. Can you allow the possibility of adding multiple Collections in one go? ...perhaps something like a checklist, and a ""done"" button to complete the additions. 2) please allow us to search within a personal Collection - like finding a restaurant type - like 'sushi' - within my diverse 'Favorite Restaurant' Collection. 3) would be great to *search* for another user's curated Collection - not just stumble upon one as with the current system on your app. 4) have a menu button option for ""things to do"" in a given city. Would be great having a good list of top-rated sights and activities for people visiting from out of town. Thank you!",4,2

If the reviews appear to be inconsistent within the same timeframe then someone is not being honest about their reviews. Otherwise great app to use!,5,225

I messaged them to try and fix an issue with them wanting to verify my identity. They messaged me back but when I try to read the message it tells me the message center is unavailable. So now I can't fix THEIR problem because I've sent them valid documentation of a credit card statement. Its just always something with this company. Used to be great.

I am on my phone a lot, so this is a deal breaker for me. I did not want this app to set something like this up all willy nilly like, and now I am locked out of my phone.
